Collection of simple conditions for certain types in JavaScript 

## About The Project
This project has focus on defining simple condition functions for determining if a certain value has certain type

## Motivation
From time to time I find myself hard-googling certain issues with types in Javascript. I wanted to make a currated list of conditions for mainly used types in JavaScript.

## Future
I want to add more conditions and tests per condition. I am also deciding if this project should be an npm package or works just as Gist for cherry-picking certain condition that suits your need.
